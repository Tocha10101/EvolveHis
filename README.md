# EvolveHis. Evolutionary algorithm + Deeper Historical Knowlegde
An implementation of (μ + λ) evolutionary algorithm with custom heuristic that uses information about the deeper ancestors than parents.
Tested on benchmark functions of the CEC-2017 Special Session and Competition on Single Objective Numerical Optimization Single Bound Constrained Real-Parameter Optimization.
